## Team Information

### Team Name
**Godzilla**

### Team Policy
- **Attendance:** Must have a good reason to skip a meeting. If you skip, ensure you obtain the necessary information from other teammates.
- **Version Control:** Work in feature branches and only create Pull Requests (PRs). Do not work directly in the `main` branch.
- **Code Integrity:** Avoid copying and pasting code from AI sources. Ensure your code includes meaningful comments.
- **Task Assignment:** Only work on tasks you are assigned. Do not attempt to take on issues outside of your scope, as this may impact other team members' work.
- **Collaboration:** It is expected that team members will occasionally assist with each other's issues. We operate as a cohesive team.
- **Communication:** English is the only language to be used during team meetings.
- **Health and Safety:** Face masks are not required.
- **Code Ownership:** Never modify someone else’s code unless you have explicit approval from the owner.
- **Accountability:** If a team member accidentally or intentionally deletes another person’s work or the group’s work, that person’s grade will be reduced by one letter (e.g., from an A to an A-).

## Project Description

**KeepOrDelete** is a fun and interactive way to manage files by providing a game-like experience similar to Tinder or other dating apps. Users can preview files and view basic information about them, then decide to either "Keep" or "Delete" the file based on the provided information.
