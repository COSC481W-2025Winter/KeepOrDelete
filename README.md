### Victor Tyler
*I’m a Computer Science major in my senior year. My strong suit languages are Python and Java. I’m interested in Systems Engineering, Databases, and some elements of Cybersecurity. I like Systems because learning how different components work together for a specific task excites me. Plus, there’s always something new and interesting to learn in each component.  In my free time I like to read (Game of Thrones preferably), weightlift, play basketball, watch anime, and travel. I’m also on the executive board for the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)*
