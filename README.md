- **Code Integrity:** Avoid copying and pasting code from AI sources. Ensure your code includes meaningful comments.
- **Task Assignment:** Only work on tasks you are assigned. Do not attempt to take on issues outside of your scope, as this may impact other team members' work.

- **Communication:** English is the only language to be used during team meetings.
- **Health and Safety:** Face masks are not required.
- **Code Ownership:** Never modify someone else’s code unless you have explicit approval from the owner.
- **Accountability:** If a team member accidentally or intentionally deletes another person’s work or the group’s work, that person’s grade will be reduced by one letter (e.g., from an A to an A-).
