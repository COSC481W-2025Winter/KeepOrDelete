# Keep or Delete â€” Installation

## Install a release version (recommended)

Visit our [Releases](https://github.com/COSC481W-2025Winter/KeepOrDelete/releases) page for precompiled binaries and executables for Windows, Mac, and Linux. See below for specific instructions on your platform.

### Windows

For Windows users, we recommend downloading and running `KeepOrDelete-Setup-X.X.X.exe`.

If Windows displays a pop-up preventing the file from executing, click "More Info", then click "Run Anyway".

### Mac

For Mac users, we recommend downloading different files depending on your system architecture:

+ ARM: `KeepOrDelete-2.1.0-arm64.dmg`
+ x64: `KeepOrDelete-2.1.0.dmg`

Keep or Delete requires special system privileges in order to run on Mac.

1. After downloading, drag KeepOrDelete to Applications folder.

### Linux

For most Linux distributions, we recommend downloading the `KeepOrDelete-X.X.X.AppImage`.

Run the AppImage by making the file executable:

```bash
$ chmod +x KeepOrDelete-X.X.X.AppImage
$ ./KeepOrDelete-X.X.X.AppImage
```

#### NixOS

For NixOS users, we recommend downloading the generic Linux AppImage and running it using the following commands:

```bash
$ nix-shell -p appimage-run
$ appimage-run KeepOrDelete-X.X.X.AppImage
```
